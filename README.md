- Hello! I'm @PixelsPix on GitHub!
- People call me Pixels, even irl, so feel free to call me that as well!
- I'm interested in numerical simulations, optimization techniques and various interactive visualizations of mathematical and engineering concepts.
- I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering major, with a great interest in fluid flow and thermodynamics.

I mostly just watch youtube all day tbh, so a fun fact is that I watch youtube all day?
For now I'm just trying to learn how to code, but if you want to contact me for some reason, please email me at pixiedavina09@gmail.com and I'll reply! ^^
